MuCloud
=======

MuCloud runs `MuMax3`_ GPU-accelerated micromagnetic simulations on the cloud, eliminating the need to have a GPU card on your computer.

With your `Amazon Web Services`_ (AWS) account, virtual computer instances are created using the `Elastic Compute Cloud`_ (EC2). These instances provide on-demand (`price per hour`_) access to physical GPU hardware, that allow the simulations to be run remotely. The script interface mimics MuMax3, so that working with MuCloud is as easy as using MuMax3 on a local computer.
